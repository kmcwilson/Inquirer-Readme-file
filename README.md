# README with node.js

## Description

This assignment uses node.js in order to generate a README file for the user. There is a package.json that includes the inquirer dependency and there are two javascript files with the necessary script for the application to function. 

## Usage

The user will enter node index.js in their terminal and will be presented with a series of questions that are pertinent for a README.md file. There are two defaults within dependencies and tests. Once the user has put in the necessary information then a README.md file is generated with that information. If the user chooses a license for their README.md file, then their file will have a license badge, a licnese section and a license link. If they do not have a license then those sections will remain empty.
